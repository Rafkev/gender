Determining the sex of a child based on genetic inheritance
Determining the sex of a child based on genetic inheritance follows the rules of Mendelian genetics. Typically, I used Punnett squares to represent the possible combinations of genes inherited from the parents. Below is a JavaScript script that simulates the determination of the sex of a child based on the parents' genetic information:

In this script:

I defined a function determineChildSex that takes the father's gene and mother's gene as inputs.
Based on the rules of Mendelian genetics for sex determination (where male is determined by the presence of the Y chromosome), 
I then demonstrated the usage of the function with example genes for the father and mother, and log the result to the console.
This is a simplified version and doesn't account for more complex genetic factors such as sex-linked traits or genetic mutations. For a more accurate simulation, you might need to consider additional genetic information and factors.
